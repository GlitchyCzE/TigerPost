A website which allows the post office to scan a packageâ€™s barcode, also known as its Postal Numeric Encoding Technique or POSTNET, and have that information uploaded to a viewable database. Students will be able to view the shipping address and other information associated with the packages they receive. If someone surprises them with a care package or gets an order without tracking information or the tracking information is not properly updating, they can check the shipping address and other information associated with the package to understand what they have received and clear up any mysteries.
